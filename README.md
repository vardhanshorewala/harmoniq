# Harmoniq

**Intelligent Clinical Trial Compliance Platform**

Harmoniq automatically maps regulatory requirements (FDA, EMA) to clinical trial protocols using knowledge graphs and advanced retrieval techniques. When regulations change, instantly identify which protocols, clauses, and studies are impacted‚Äîeliminating weeks of manual document review.

---

## üéØ The Problem

**Current Reality for Clinical Research Organizations (CROs):**

- **160+ days lost** when FDA/EMA regulations change
- **Manual review** of hundreds of pages across thousands of protocol versions
- **Weeks of work** to find which trial clauses are impacted by new rules
- **Traditional vector search fails** to capture relationships between regulations
- **Unstructured, messy documents** with inconsistent formatting
- Each delay costs **$6M+ per day** in lost drug development time

**Example Scenario:**
```
FDA updates 21 CFR Part 50 (Informed Consent requirements)
‚Üì
Which protocols are affected?
Which countries need updates?
Which clauses need revision?
Which trials are at risk?
```

Current solutions require **weeks of manual auditing**. Harmoniq provides answers **in seconds**.

---

## üí° The Solution

Harmoniq uses **Knowledge Graphs + HippoRAG** to:

1. **Extract atomic requirements** from messy, unstructured regulation PDFs
2. **Build semantic relationship graphs** between requirements (LLM-powered)
3. **Retrieve relevant regulations** using hybrid vector + graph search (Personalized PageRank)
4. **Check protocol compliance** with AI agents that understand regulatory context
5. **Track impact** across documents, studies, and jurisdictions

### Key Innovation: HippoRAG-Inspired Retrieval

Unlike traditional RAG systems that only use vector similarity, Harmoniq combines:

- **Vector Search** (ChromaDB): "What regulations mention similar concepts?"
- **Graph Propagation** (Personalized PageRank): "What else is connected through dependencies?"
- **Agent Analysis**: "Is this protocol actually compliant?"

This finds **indirect relationships** that pure vector search misses.

## üî¨ How It Works

### 1. **Regulation Ingestion** (One-Time Setup)

```python
# Upload FDA regulation PDF
POST /api/regulations/upload
{
  "file": "21-CFR-Part-50.pdf",
  "country": "USA",
  "authority": "FDA"
}
```

**What happens:**
1. Extract text from PDF (pypdf)
2. Chunk into semantic paragraphs (~1500 chars)
3. Agent extracts **atomic requirements** from messy text
   - "Sponsors must not promote investigational drugs"
   - "IRB must review protocols before initiation"
4. Generate embeddings (sentence-transformers)
5. Store in ChromaDB with metadata
6. Agent extracts **semantic relationships**
   - REQ-001 RELATED_TO REQ-005 (both about consent)
   - REQ-003 RELATED_TO REQ-007 (both about data integrity)
7. Build knowledge graph with 3 edge types:
   - `RELATED_TO` (LLM-extracted semantic relationships)
   - `SIMILAR_TO` (embedding cosine similarity > 0.75)
   - `NEARBY` (sequential chunks, ¬±1 neighbor)
8. Save graph to disk (persistent NetworkX)

**Result:** 179 regulation nodes, 431 relationship edges

---

### 2. **Protocol Compliance Check** (Real-Time Query)

```python
POST /api/regulations/check-compliance
{
  "protocol_paragraph": "All participants will provide written informed consent...",
  "country": "USA",
  "top_k": 10
}
```

**What happens:**

#### Phase 1: HippoRAG Retrieval (~400ms)
1. Embed protocol text ‚Üí vector
2. ChromaDB finds top-10 most similar regulations
3. Use these as **seed nodes** for graph walk
4. Run **Personalized PageRank** on knowledge graph
   - Spreads relevance through edges
   - Finds indirectly related regulations
5. Return top-K ranked by PPR score

#### Phase 2: Compliance Analysis (~2-4s)
1. Send protocol + retrieved regulations to agent
2. LLM analyzes each regulation:
   - Is it actually related to this protocol text?
   - If related, does protocol comply?
   - What's missing to achieve compliance?
3. Filter to only related regulations
4. Calculate weighted compliance score
5. Identify critical violations

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "NON_COMPLIANT",
  "overall_compliance_score": 0.161,
  "related_regulations": 4,
  "compliant_count": 1,
  "non_compliant_count": 3,
  "critical_violations": [
    {
      "regulation_id": "FDA-CHUNK16-REQ-004",
      "explanation": "Protocol does not specify all ¬ß50.25 consent requirements",
      "missing_elements": ["voluntary participation", "withdrawal rights"]
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    ["voluntary participation statement"],
    ["withdrawal rights"]
  ]
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Knowledge Graph Structure

**Nodes:**
- Atomic regulatory requirements
- Metadata: severity (critical/high/medium), section, text, country

**Edges:**
- `RELATED_TO`: LLM-extracted semantic relationships (confidence weighted)
- `SIMILAR_TO`: Embedding cosine similarity > 0.75
- `NEARBY`: Sequential document structure (¬±1 neighbor)

### Agent System

**1. Semantic Parser Agent**
- Extracts 10-20 atomic requirements per chunk
- Identifies topic, severity, requirement type
- Handles messy/unstructured text

**2. Relationship Extraction Agent**
- Processes requirements in batches of 30
- Finds semantic relationships (not just keyword matching)
- Generates confidence scores

**3. Compliance Analysis Agent**
- Determines if regulations are actually related
- Checks compliance with tolerant criteria
- Provides actionable remediation steps

### Why HippoRAG?

Traditional RAG:
```
Query ‚Üí Vector Search ‚Üí Return top-K
‚ùå Misses indirect relationships
‚ùå Keyword-dependent
```

HippoRAG:
```
Query ‚Üí Vector Search (seeds) ‚Üí PageRank (graph walk) ‚Üí Return top-K
‚úÖ Finds indirect dependencies
‚úÖ Understands semantic structure
‚úÖ Better recall for complex queries
```
